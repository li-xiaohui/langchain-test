You have access to the following tools:\\n\\ntime: time(text: str) -> str - Returns todays date, use this for any     questions related to knowing todays date.     The input should always be an empty string,     and this function will always return todays     date - any date mathmatics should occur     outside this function.\\n\\nThe way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.\\nSpecifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).\\n\\nThe only values that should be in the \\\"action\\\" field are: time\\n\\nThe $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"action\\\": $TOOL_NAME,\\n  \\\"action_input\\\": $INPUT\\n}\\n```\\n\\nALWAYS use the following format:\\n\\nQuestion: the input question you must answer\\nThought: you should always think about what to do\\nAction:\\n```\\n$JSON_BLOB\\n```\\nObservation: the result of the action\\n...
